Rays of Sound

This website was born out of the determination of Victoria University of Wellington's Language Learning Centre to save some older, but valuable stories and songs on tape and make them more accessible for everyone to enjoy. After securing permission from the copyright holders for digitisation, we created this website and embedded the audio material for online streaming. The result is a digital audio-book shelf which breathes new life into precious, but long-underused resources.

This project is under developmen for our SWEN302 agile methods course.
